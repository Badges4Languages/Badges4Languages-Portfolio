# Badges4Languages-Portfolio

The European Language Portfolio is a personal document of a learner. In this document learners of all ages can record their language learning and cultural experiences at school or outside school.

The Principles and Guidelines approved by the Council of Europe (DGIV/ EDU/LANG (2000) 3) define the three components of the ELP as follows:
* The Language Passport section provides an overview of the individual’s proficiency in different languages at a given point in time; the overview is defined in terms of skills and the common reference levels in the Common European Framework; it records formal qualifications and describes language competencies and significant language and intercultural learning experiences; it includes information on partial and specific competence; it allows for self-assessment, teacher assessment and assessment by educational institutions and examinations boards; it requires that information entered in the Passport states on what basis, when and by whom the assessment was carried out. To facilitate pan-European recognition and mobility a standard presentation of a Passport Summary is promoted by the Council of Europe for ELPs for adults.
* The Language Biography facilitates the learner’s involvement in planning, reflecting upon and assessing his or her learning process and progress; it encourages the learner to state what he/she can do in each language and to include information on linguistic and cultural experiences gained in and outside formal
educational contexts; it is organized to promote plurilingualism, i.e. the development of competencies in a number of languages.
* The Dossier offers the learner the opportunity to select materials to document
and illustrate achievements or experiences recorded in the Language Biography
or Passport.

## For Students

### The Language Passport

[The Language Passport](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portfolio/the-language-passport)provides an overview of the individual’s proficiency in different languages at a given point in time. It is expected that the learner will update the language passport at regular intervals, to reflect progress in language learning and the acquisition of new intercultural experiences.

All ELP Language Passports should include the [self-assessment Grid](docs/European_Language_Portfolio/Assessment_Grid_EN) from the Common European Framework in its entirety as a basic point of reference.

The overview, based on the Self-assessment Grid is defined in terms of the skills (Listening, Reading, Spoken Interaction, Spoken Production, Writing) and the common reference levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) in the [Common European Framework of Reference](docs/CEFR_EN). It allows the user to record information on partial and specific competences. Note that the inclusion of self-assessment in the passport emphasizes that the ELP belongs to the individual learner, not to the issuing body or institution.

The Language Passport also records formal qualifications and describes language competences and significant language and intercultural learning experiences. The recording of assessment by teachers, educational institutions and examinations boards can be accommodated in the language passport in a number of different ways. However, the principle of learner ownership means that teacher assessment should always be separate from the learner’s self-assessment and not used to correct it.

The Language Passport should also be detachable from the rest of the model so that it may be used by the holder for presentation purposes.

### The Language Biography

[The Language Biography](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portfolio/the-language-biography) facilitates the learner’s involvement in planning, reflecting upon and assessing his or her learning process and progress.

The Language Biography contains goal-setting and self-assessment checklists that expand on the summary descriptors contained in the Self-assessment Grid.

The Language Biography also encourages the learner to state what he/she can do in each language and to include information on linguistic, cultural and learning experiences gained in and outside formal educational contexts. It is organized to promote plurilingualism, i.e. the development of proficiency in a number of languages.

The Language Biography section of the ELP offer the headings below.

#### Plurilingual profile

The Language Biography usually opens with a section where the learner has the opportunity to reflect on and present their language and cultural background.

[User’s plurilingual profile](docs/European_Language_Portfolio/Biography/ELP_Biography_Plurilingual_Profile_EN.pdf)

#### Goal-setting and learning how to learn

Facilitates the learner’s involvement in planning, reflecting upon and assessing his or her learning process and progres.

[Goal-setting and learning how to learn Templates](docs/European_Language_Portfolio/Biography/ELP_Biography_LearningtoLearn_Templates_EN.pdf)

#### Intercultural awareness and experience

As with the Learning how to learn pages, you are advised to consider how the pages may be re-used and stored.

When considering the pages it is worth bearing two further points in mind. First, although the intercultural dimension of the ELP is explicitly associated with “respect for diversity of cultures and ways of life” (Council for Cultural Cooperation 2000), we need to be sensitive to cultural similarity as well as cultural difference, to sameness as well as otherness. Secondly, while ELPs designed for adolescent and adult learners often associate the intercultural dimension with residence abroad, it should be remembered that intercultural encounters may also occur in the learner’s home context.

The Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters [www.coe.int/lang-autobiography](www.coe.int/lang-autobiography) is another Council of Europe product that may address your needs in this area.

[Intercultural awareness and experience templates](docs/European_Language_Portfolio/Biography/ELP_Biography_Intercultural_Component_Templates_EN.pdf)

#### Self-assessment checklists

Checklists of “I can” descriptors expand the general descriptors of the self-assessment grid into a detailed inventory of communicative activity that can be used for regular goal-setting and self-assessment. They also mediate to learners the CEFR’s action-oriented approach, which describes language learning as a variety of language use.

[Generic checklists for use in ELPs designed for language learners](docs/European_Language_Portfolio/Biography/ELP_Biography_Generic_checklists_EN.pdf)

### The Dossier

The dossier is the part of the ELP that most closely corresponds to the artist’s portfolio. For younger learners it may be rather like a scrap book in which target language materials are collected to complement or “decorate” the textbook and provide a focus for ownership of the foreign language learning process and the language itself. Older school learners may fill their dossier with the outcomes of project work related more or less closely to the skills in which they will be tested in public exams. Adult learners will probably want to present evidence of their ability to perform real-life tasks in their target language(s), so their dossier is likely to contain sample letters, memoranda, brief reports and the like. Of course, ELP owners may want to demonstrate their speaking as well as their writing skills, and they can do this by including an audio or video cassette in their dossier.

## For Teachers
### The European Profiling Grid
[The European Profiling Grid (EPG)](docs/ProfilingGrid/EPG.pdf) main purpose of which is to provide language teachers, teacher-trainers and managers with a reliable means of outlining current competences and enhancing professionalism in language education. The ultimate aim is to increase the quality and efficiency of the training and professional development of language teachers.

More specifically the EPG is intended to:

* assist self-assessment and mapping of a range of current language teaching skills and competences;
* outline individual and group profiles of language teachers in an institution, stating the levels of competence attained according to a set of categories and descriptors;
* help to identify development needs and training programmes;
* serve as an additional tool for staff selection and appraisal;
* assist in understanding of and communication between different pedagodical systems and educational traditions in Europe;
* foster transparency of teaching standards, facilitating teacher mobility.

The EPG is not meant to be a checklist for observations, for job interviews or performance reviews. It can only serve as an additional reference point for aspects of appointing and assessing staff. Its main aim is to provide a snapshot of the current phases of professional development of teachers in various European countries and help them realise their potential for growth.

### The EAQUALS Framework for language teacher training and development
The [TD-FRAM](docs/ProfilingGrid/EAQUALS_TD_FRAM.pdf) is related to the European Profiling Grid (the EPG), which provides an overview of the main training and experience, competences, and professionalism of language teachers at six successive phases in their development. The TDRAM adds to this a much more detailed but open-ended description of the key professional competences in terms of attitudes, knowledge and skills needed by language teachers at three main phases of development
