## Complements

### Theme
[Listify](https://themeforest.net/item/listify-wordpress-directory-theme/9602611)
 is a top rated and popular directory theme. It’s compatible with several WordPress plugins (the WP Job Manager and WooCommerce plugins are required with the theme) and booking services as well. To add to this, [Astoundify provides detailed documentation](http://listify.astoundify.com/)
, and several hooks and settings to customize the look of the theme.

To be clear, the theme doesn’t come bundled with these plugins. You’ll have to download them yourself (and some may require a purchase). What we’ve done, however, is code the theme to support and style the integration with those plugins so that you can add all the functionality you like, while still looking great!

* To offer a directory of classes (for Language Academies, Language Schools, Teachers,)

## OpenBadges
Open Badges are verifiable, portable digital badges with embedded metadata about skills and achievements. They comply with the Open Badges Specification and are shareable across the web.

Each Open Badge is associated with an image and information about the badge, its recipient, the issuer, and any supporting evidence. All this information may be packaged within a badge image file that can be displayed via online CVs and social networks. Thousands of organizations across the world issue badges in accordance with the Open Badges Specification, from non-profits to major employers to educational institutions at all levels.

### Developers Guide
Badges for Languages use OpenBadges API for the delivery of the credentials (Badges). The badges go from the plugin to the [Backpack](https://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack/welcome).

This section provides a set of technical resources to guide you through the processes of creating, issuing and displaying Open Badges. The Specification provides technical documentation and code examples. These guides will build on those examples.

### openbadges-backpack
With the Issuer API, you can push earner badges to the Mozilla hosted Backpack. This tutorial will walk you through the process of sending earner badges to the Backpack via the Issuer API script. The API handles getting the earner's permission to push to their Backpack, so your own code only has to pass the details of badges you are trying to send, then if necessary retrieve the response from the API.
[Using the Issuer API](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki/using-the-issuer-api)

As an issuer, you can push earner badges to the Mozilla hosted Backpack with their permission. You can do this using the Issuer API or using Backpack Connect. This guide demonstrates using the Backpack Connect approach to send earner badges to their Backpacks.

With the Issuer API, the user must grant permission every time you attempt to push to their Backpack. With Backpack Connect, you can manage user permission on an ongoing basis, using a persistent session. Once the earner has granted you permission to push badges to their Backpack, you will be able to do so without their interaction unless they revoke your permission, which they can do at any time.

To manage your interaction with the earner Backpack, the Connect API uses access tokens.
