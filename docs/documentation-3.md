# BadgesforLanguages-Grid
BadgesforLanguages-Grid, integrated with Badges-Issuer-for-wp offer to the users languages certifications for the validation of their current level of languages.
* For language students, the Grid provides the self-assessment grid of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR Table 2)
* For language teachers, the Grid provides a framework of stages of development, not an assessment grid suitable for assessing the quality of a teacher’s teaching.

Badges for languages is created for second languages education only.

## About the Framework (or better grid????)
* They focus on the positive, i.e. what teachers can do, not what they can’t do.
* They are not linear scales to evaluate overall competence. Each framework has different categories, which allow for a non-linear development overall as the process of learning to teach is not a linear accrual of various teaching competences.
* They generate a profile of where the teacher is at a given point in time, and indicate which competences they might wish to develop in the future.
* For any individual as well as within teams of teachers, development is likely to be jagged, and not uniform, across the different areas and competences. It is likely that teachers, even experienced teachers, will be good at some things and less effective at others, and that individual teacher profiles will change as responsibilities evolve and new challenges arise.
* The frameworks are easy to understand and to use.
* They are primarily developmental tools, and are intended to support ongoing teacher development.
